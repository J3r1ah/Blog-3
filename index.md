# Intoduction


Ive Learned a good amount about AI (ARTIFICIAL INTELIGENCE) in the 3rd marking period in the  Full Stack Development Pathway And ive considered allot of concepts within the timeframe of learning about AI in the Full Stack Development pathway These Concept being Technological Distopia higley influenced by the Movie I-Robot.

This Movie Was Showcased Roughly inthe middle of the AI module in Marking period 3 and was attached to a assignment basically explaining the movie and how it influenced your thoughts onthe concept of a distopian world full of technological advancements and technological conveinece through personalized robots.


# What Is I-Robot 


I Robot is a Movie Staring Will smith a very famous actor in a whole lotta other shows and movies his most popular i believe is the fresh prince of bel air. but yeah he plays in this movie as a detective in a world where personalized robots are used for everything from most jobs to personalized conveinece through home jobs like tutors cleaners chefs anything a personal assistant does.

These robots are individualy sent out by a large corperation that is in charge of manufacturing maintaining and shipping these robots for general work like ive mentioned common jobs aand even law enforcement.Will Smith plays a role of a detective that has a difficult history with these robots and he is inthe veiw thatthey are no good and they ruin lives. This experience he had with said robot was i believe a crash where two cars where drowning one with will in it andthe other with a child and its parents 
a rescue robot analyzed both cars and decided that will had a better chance at surviving then the so by odds it would have made sense to save will.

Will is angered bythis because his life was saved instead of the childs with this experience he comes to resent these robots and wants them gone . will after has multiple encounters where these very robots malfuction aand try to kill will which makes him further beleive that they are no good for humanity and they are harmful and inhumane 
for humans.

a robot named sunny is introduced as one of the convience robots that has gained sentience and as will and wills friend come to realize that it has gained sentience they try to restet aka kill him in sunny eyes. they end up not reseting sunny and will interigates his sentience. this fact quickly becomes problem within the corperation and they send there aartificial law enforcement on will becuase he's envolved with sunny will takes them down and reveal parts of his body is artificial because ofthe accident with the drowning cars. 

will loses his detective license because the destrution property and his blames on the robot corperation sounds like delusion to the other detctives and their boss so will works with his friend in the coperationd and sunny to bring it down and shortly after planning the corperation commenses a purge on the city this purge not ran by the ceo but the simulacrum that contriols the robots will sunny and the girl find away to shut it down a rid their city of these robots and i beleivbe sunny loses his sentience and dies.



# How Do I feel


I feel As if the moovie was very interesting and very engaging when i was watching it though i have doubts that this our current technological advancements will get to that point any time soon if not ever if we die out before we can.

Though it did have me consider what if these things happened and we had to face a big corperations of Robots Enforcing a purge upon us. I'm not sure thats something that we could come back from or live from like yes i strongly beleive in the indomitable human spirit but tbh things that are made tpo carry out task better an beyond with inhuman strenth at large mass word seem borderline impossible for us at mass to beat given that evrything including nuclear warfgare would be run by technology probably accesible buy said robots if we fought back we would run ourselves to an early grave.

Though i have more thoughts it was a good movie and i realy made me thing about a possible future that we may have due to technologies extremley fast rate of advancement.
